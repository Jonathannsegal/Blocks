__Blocks a map game built for SE319__

I took the class SE319, Construction of User Interfaces at Iowa State which has a project based component. My friend and I worked on a team to design, build, and release an app. I learned a lot about the application building process from Research, Design, Development and how all steps come together to deploy a finished product.
